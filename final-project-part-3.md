## Personality Test Project Concept Update
... I changed my idea. Throughout the development of my story, I found a lot of difficulty in drawing meaningful conclusions, unable to find relevant data. Perhaps conducting more thoughtful research throughout each step was necessary. The project turned out to be infeasible with the amount of time left compared to the time needed to create a meaningful story. Overall, it was an ambitious project however, I learned a lot of lessons and information about personality test usage for hiring processes. 

## Continuing... and the Structure of my new project idea. 

> Adoption in the U.S. - Breaking down trends, policies, and impact

As a reader, I want to learn further about adoption trends in the U.S. and how these trends are changing over time. This will allow me to understand where resources, education, and awareness are lacking for adoptees and families.

Call to Action: Increase support and resources for adoptees and families and reduce the misconceptions about adoption. Continue educating each other to improve the adoption/foster care system.

Data Visualizations to make:
- Adopted, in foster homes, in orphanages
- Overall adoption trends in the U.S.
- By State count
- Gender, Age, Demographic
- Interracial adoption
- Adoption policy changes in the U.S.

The audience for this topic: general public, children's education and adoption policy and lawmakers, researchers, support organizations for children, prospective adoptive parents, parents who have adopted, any member of the public who wants to learn more about the adoption process or have the means to help.

## Tableau Data Visualizations and Story

From looking at recent data, about 54,000 children were adopted in 2021 leaving 113,589 still in the foster care system waiting to be adopted. Here is a quick visualization showing the overall trend in adoption from 2012 to 2021. We see a steady increase, peaking in 2019, then trending down most likely due to covid 19 reasons.

The data visualization below shows the adoption average rates per state in the US. We can see that California has the highest rate of adoption from 2017-2021.

Splitting the states into regions (using the national geographic map and definition of regions), it can be concluded that the southeast region has the highest rate of adopting children from 2017 to 2021. (Children's Bureau)

> Conclusions

1. A final writeup for Part III on a new Github page that summarizes all the work you've done thus far to create your final project.

Taking lots of different paths and turns, I concluded with a story on adoption trends in the US with an emphasis on the importance of staying up to date with current issues around the adoption and foster care system in the US. Using Tableau as my main source of creating the data visualizations, I created an overarching area/line graph representing and introducing the change in adoption from 2017 to 2021. I created several other visualizations focusing on the specific states and regions in the US and what the trends looked like in those categorizations. Then, I dived deeper and found data from the Children's Bureau and analyzed adoption rates considering different demographics such as ethnicity, age, etc. Separate research was conducted to understand the different federal laws enacted from the early 1970s to today. Keeping within the scope of ethnicity, I compared the total children population with the adopted children population which resulted in some interesting findings. I used data from multiple sources like the United States Census Bureau and the Children's Bureau. I also used Canva and existing graphics and images within Canva to create supplemental visualizations for the final presentation. Shorthand was my ultimate platform to present my final presentation with Tableau being my main source for making the data visualizations. Many many sorting and excel calculations/sheets were used to aggregate data to create the data visualizations. 

A short description explaining the decision to shift gears is mentioned at the top of this page. 

Before presenting the final presentation, I was able to conduct short user research feedback sessions by asking some of my peers and friends to read through my shortened shorthand story. I ended up getting very useful feedback and I was able to make changes to improve how the story was being told. Some of my peers had mentioned that the visualizations needed a little more context and clarity in titles would have been useful. Although broad, the overall major statistics and visualizations effectively framed the story. From having struggled A LOT in drawing meaningful stories from my limited findings with the personality test, the process the second time around was a lot more efficient. With plentiful data, conclusions were able to be drawn to create an interesting story. I ended with a call to action that supporting policies, educating each other, and sharing opportunities are ways to support the adoption and foster case system and children in the US.
