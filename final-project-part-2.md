## Final Project Part 2

Failing my original idea to find trends between **top 100 revenue-generating companies in the US** and **career options for the 16 personality types**, I decided to take a more personal approach and dive deeper into my personality type. After taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, also known as the 16 Personality test, my results reflected the Introverted Intuitive Feeling Judging (INFJ) personality type. 

It is very interesting and left me wondering how 130 questions categorized me into one of 16 personalities. Let alone, another interesting aspect is how Fortune 500 companies mandate an MBTI test to determine hiring. This means most employees at Walmart, Amazon, Apple, Exxon, Berkshire Hathaway, and more have taken this test and have gotten hired depending on their results. 

Using the data that I had already aggregated from my failed attempt, I used the information existing to back up the "ideal" career options for the personality of an INFJ.

To further preface this, there are xx% of INFJ's from the 22 million test respondents. The visualization below depicts the % of the 16 different personality types.

It is important to not disregard the other uses of this test such as to determine who and what types of people would fit into the work and team culture, etc. Or the other general uses, such as in determining personal xxxxxxxxxx. 



I, for sure, resonated with the results and the information backing it. That isn't to say that I agree with the methods of companies mandating this test to fit millions of employees into 16 different personalities. Nor do I believe that these tests consider the "uniqueness" of every individual person.
