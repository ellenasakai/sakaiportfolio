## Final Project Part 1 Continue

| Outline | set-up, conflict, resolution |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Set-Up | Personality tests are a factor in determining hiring opportunities. Companies use MBTI tests to decipher personality types, such as the top 100 Fortune companies. |
| Conflict | As the tool remains a very powerful form of assessment, one might combat this by pointing out the ethical concerns and validity of measuring innumerable amounts of human personalities. Personally, as an INFJ, using the existing data I found, it is said that this personality type tends to go for careers within the xxx field.|
| Resolution | It is important to redetermine whether personality tests have an accurate say on one's hiring determination. Practicing other forms and creating more personable ways of determining personality types is necessary. |

As a reader, I want to **xx.** This will allow me to **xx.**   

New CALL TO ACTION: I can do this by...
- suggesting that employers should implement in-person team activities (such as during interview processes) rather than taking a personality test.
- sharing this information with others who might not be aware of how broadly used these tests are.
- considering the proper and ethical uses of this test

It is important to not disregard the other uses of this test such as to determine who and what types of people would fit into the work and team culture, etc. Or the other general uses, such as in determining personal xxxxxxxxxx. 

## Final Project Part 2

Failing my original idea to find trends between **top 100 revenue-generating companies in the US** and **career options for the 16 personality types**, I decided to take a more personal approach and dive deeper into my personality type. After taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, also known as the 16 Personality test, my results reflected the Introverted Intuitive Feeling Judging (INFJ) personality type. 

It is very interesting and left me wondering how 130 questions categorized me into one of 16 personalities. Let alone, another interesting aspect is how Fortune 500 companies mandate MBTI testing as a hiring criterion. This means most employees at Walmart, Amazon, Apple, Exxon, Berkshire Hathaway, and more have taken this test and have gotten hired or not depending on their results. Obviously, that isn't the only factor in accepting an applicant.

Using the data that I had already aggregated from my failed attempt, I used the information existing to back up the "ideal" career options for the personality of an INFJ and ESTP as personas.

To further describe viz 1, there are 7.55% of INFJ's and 2.32% of ENTP's from the 22 million test respondents in the United States. Overall, the visualization depicts the percentage of the 16 different personality types.

I, for sure, resonated with the results and the information backing it. That isn't to say that I agree with the methods of companies mandating this test to fit millions of employees into 16 different personalities. Nor do I believe that these tests consider the "uniqueness" of every individual person. 



## User Research and Interviews

#### User research Protocol
  a. **The target audience you hope to reach with your story**: The target audience would be the general population. Considering the MBTI test has been around and has multiple uses in different professions and sectors, the story would effectively reach those who are familiar with the test. Further, the story could also be enlightening (or not) to those who have never heard the test. 
  b. **Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**: 
  - one interviewee who has taken the MBTI test before
  - one interviewee who has not taken the MBTI test
  - one interviewee who is familiar with the test
  - I believe that through interviewing these individuals, I will be able to get various perspectives of the story which will allow me to narrow down the focus of the story if need be. I am interested to see feedback from the individual who has not taken the MBTI test before. 

  c. **Interview script**:
  1. What story is being told? What are your takeaways?
  2. Is there any part of the story you find surprising or confusing? Are the visualizations engaging?
