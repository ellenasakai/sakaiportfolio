## Final Project Part I (Version 2)

## <font color="#FF0000"> Updated Project Concept: </font>
Narrowing down the concept of my project, I will be looking specifically at the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test (MBTI) personality types, the location of Fortune 100 companies, and an overview of MBTI types in the U.S. states. 

There are a lot of rising issues regarding companies' use of MBTI tests as a hiring criterion. I am interested to see the percentage of people living in different states in the US and how the results of the personality test correlate to where the fortune 100 companies are located. 

> Brief history and facts
- The MBTI test was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Meyer (daughter), based on Carl Jung's original theory of psychological types. (1919)
- What is it? A self-report questionnaire designed to assess personality preferences across four personality aspects: Introversion/Extraversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. The combination of these create 16 personality types.
- When is it used? Workplaces, education, and psychological assessment, counseling
- How did it gain popularity?
- Who takes this test? the test remains the most popular personality test in the world and is taken by more than two million people annually.
- Where is this market headed? In 2021, the market for the MBTI testing alone generates $20 million in revenue each year. By 2027, the personality testing industry is expected to be a $6.5 billion industry (leaders) with there already being well over 2,500 personality assessments.
- "Instead, they lean toward type-based measures such as the Myers-Briggs (rather trait-based measures like the Big 5). Type-based measures don't give people scores on continuous scales but instead categorize them into distinct 'types'" (https://daily.jstor.org/why-companies-are-so-interested-in-your-myers-briggs-type/)

> Company Uses
- Benefits: "Focusing on 'fit' of employees/hirees" : behaviors, culture fit, team building, communication preferences, leadership coaching, etc.
- Overshadowed factors: limited scope, accessibility for all, ...


### <font color="#FF0000"> Project Outline V2 </font>
 *One sentence summary for your project*: Personality tests are being used as a criterion in hiring processes. The most common test used is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test and over 80% of Fortune 500 companies use this to determine and summarize what types of personality traits employees carry. 

As a reader, I want to **understand the benefits and detriments of personality tests** so that I can **share with those entering the workforce that personality tests are being utilized as part of the hiring criteria for certain companies and organizations**.

As a reader, I want to **observe and analyze the personality types throughout the U.S., look at where the top 100 Fortune companies are located, and look into data that categorizes different professions into certain MBTI personality types.** This will allow me to **see trends and tell a story about which personality types are working in these companies.**   

I can do this by...
- suggesting that employers should implement in-person team activities (such as during interview processes) rather than taking a personality test.
- sharing this information with others who might not be aware of how broadly used these tests are. 

| Outline | set-up, conflict, resolution |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Set-Up | Personality tests are a factor in determining hiring opportunities. Companies use MBTI tests to decipher personality types, such as the top 100 Fortune companies. |
| Conflict | As the tool remains a very powerful form of assessment, one might combat this by pointing out the ethical concerns and validity of measuring innumerable amounts of human personalities. With there being several million employees combined in the Fortune 100 companies, those employees are categorized into 16 personality types and 4 distinct categories.|
| Resolution | It is important to redetermine whether personality tests have an accurate say on one's hiring determination. |

### Steps to Collect Data:

1. To start from the very top, I looked into the different personality types resulting from the MBTI test. The following are the categories...
     
| 4 Roles | Personality Aspects/Types |
|---------|---------------|
| Analysts| INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP |
| Diplomats | INFJ, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP |
| Sentinals | ISTJ, ESFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ|
| Explorers | ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP |

2. Next, I created my own dataset by aggregating data from the United States Personality Map provided by 16Personalities. The test takers results were represented in their respective personality types and the map included the % of different personality types per state.

3. Following that, Using a dataset on _Suggested Careers for Myers-Briggs Type_, I parsed through the given career options and narrowed them down so that they aligned with the Fortune 100 industry sectors(see below).

4. Using _Fortune's: Mapping the Fortune 100_, I collected further data on where these 100 companies were located AND which industry sectors the companies fell into. (ie. Company: Amazon, State: Washington, Industry sector: Retail.)
- It is important to note here that I renamed/relabeled some of the industry sectors so that they overlapped with the MBTI & career dataset as seen in step 3.

5. Now, taking all this data...
- step 1:

After taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, also known as the 16 Personality test, my results reflected the INFJ personality type. It is very interesting and left me wondering how 130 questions categorized me into one of 16 personalities. Let alone, another interesting aspect is how Fortune 500 companies mandate an MBTI test to determine hiring. This means most employees at Walmart, Amazon, Apple, Exxon, Berkshire Hathaway, and more have taken this test and have gotten hired depending on their results. 

It is important to not disregard the other uses of this test such as to determine who and what types of people would fit into the work and team culture, etc. 

I, for sure, resonated with the results and the information backing it. That isn't to say that I agree with the methods of companies mandating this test to fit millions of employees into 16 different personalities. Nor do I believe that these tests consider the "uniqueness" of every individual person. 

Failing my original idea to find trends between top 100 revenue-generating companies in the US and career options for the 16 personality types, I decided to take a more personal approach and dive deeper into my own personality type. Using the data that I had already aggregated from my failed attempt, I used the information and data existing to back up the "ideal" career options for an Introverted Intuitive Feeling Judging (INFJ) personality type. 

Interestingly, I further found that XX% of 22 million respondents(test takers) resulted with the INFJ type.

According to the

I would like to challenge myself with Shorthand and incorporate interactive aspects from Shorthand itself and also from Canva. I envision that my final presentation format will have a simple theme with descriptive personable visualizations to describe the use and clear conflict of personality assessments.

## Final Project Part I (Version 1)

## Project Concept
> Is it ethical to use personality type as a hiring criteria or social criteria?

### Project Outline V1
> *High-Level Summary: Couple of paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project* 
> Project Structure:
    - *outlines major elements of story,
    - Read Chapter 8 good charts,
    - describe what you hope to achieve,
    - how will the story unfold,
    - incorporate story arcs from in-class exercises along with your user stories and
    - one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.*

I am personally very curious as to how one can determine and categorize themselves or others through a personality test. It is interesting to see that more recently, conversations and social status are categorized through these different personality traits and tests and are very publically vocalized. I would like to find as many pertinent datasets, but am currently looking at the most used tests today.

Personality tests or assessments, according to the American Psychological Association (APA)...
> "is a proficiency in professional psychology that involves the administration, scoring, and interpretation of empirically supported measures of personality traits and styles in order to: Refine clinical diagnoses, structure and inform psychological interventions, and increase the accuracy of behavioral prediction in a variety of contexts and settings"

By 2027, the personality testing industry is expected to be a $6.5 billion industry (leaders) with there already being well over 2,500 personality assessments (Psychometric success). Further, it was interesting to read about how 80% of Fortune 500 Companies use personality tests (https://leaders.com/articles/business/personality-tests/) to determine the hiring of their employees. 

For this final project, I hope to achieve a data visualization that shows the positive and negative effects of mandating a personality assessment within a working environment.

Side Note: I am attempting to search for data relating to cultural and diverse perceptions on personality types and traits-- This would be a separate column in my combined final dataset.

Currently digging through several links but am running into finding proper csv files. I have found a very useful source below. 
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/big-five-personality-test/data
3. ---
I will need to parse through these csv files and determine groups and categories of personalities for both the MBTI  and Big Five personality types. It would be interesting to see similarities or differences when analyzing the two different test results.
