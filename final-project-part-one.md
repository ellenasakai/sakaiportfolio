## Final Project Part I

## Project Concept
> Is it ethical to use personality type as a hiring criteria or social criteria?
>
> <font color="#FF0000"> Narrowing down the concept of my project, I will be looking specifically at the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test (MBTI), employees who are artists or have some degree of art background within their profession, and issues that arise within mandating a personality test as a hiring criterion. </font>

## Project Outline V1
> *High-Level Summary: Couple of paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project* 
> Project Structure:
    - *outlines major elements of story,
    - Read Chapter 8 good charts,
    - describe what you hope to achieve,
    - how will the story unfold,
    - incorporate story arcs from in-class exercises along with your user stories and
    - one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.*

I am personally very curious as to how one can determine and categorize themselves or others through a personality test. It is interesting to see that more recently, conversations and social status are categorized through these different personality traits and tests and are very publically vocalized. I would like to find as many pertinent datasets, but am currently looking at the most used tests today.

Personality tests or assessments, according to the American Psychological Association (APA)...
> "is a proficiency in professional psychology that involves the administration, scoring, and interpretation of empirically supported measures of personality traits and styles in order to: Refine clinical diagnoses, structure and inform psychological interventions, and increase the accuracy of behavioral prediction in a variety of contexts and settings"

By 2027, the personality testing industry is expected to be a $6.5 billion industry (leaders) with there already being well over 2,500 personality assessments (Psychometric success). Further, it was interesting to read about how 80% of Fortune 500 Companies use personality tests (https://leaders.com/articles/business/personality-tests/) to determine the hiring of their employees. 

For this final project, I hope to achieve a data visualization that shows the positive and negative effects of mandating a personality assessment within a working environment.

Set-Up: Personality tests are a factor in determining both hiring opportunities and psychological personality traits. There are over 2,500 personality tests.
Conflict: As the tool remains a very powerful form of assessment, one might combat this by pointing out the ethical concerns and validity of measuring innumerable amounts of human personalities.
Resolution: It is important to redetermine whether personality tests have an accurate say on one's hiring determination.

Side Note: I am attempting to search for data relating to cultural and diverse perceptions on personality types and traits-- This would be a separate column in my combined final dataset.

### Project Outline V2
> <font color="#FF0000"> 
*One sentence summary for your project*: Personality tests are being used as a criterion in hiring processes. The most common test used is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test and over 80% of Fortune 500 companies use this to determine and summarize what types of personality traits employees carry. 

> As a reader, I want to **understand the benefits and detriments of personality tests** so that I can **share with those entering the workforce that personality tests are being utilized as part of the hiring criteria for certain companies and organizations**.

> I can do this by...
    * suggesting that employers should implement in-person team activities (such as during interview processes) rather than taking a personality test.
    * sharing this information with others who might not be aware of how broadly used these tests are.
</font>




## Initial Sketches
> *should mimic and follow aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project, build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project*


## The data
> *identify primary sources, note: for the final project you'll need to get a copy of the data or recreate it based on various sources, make sure to record all sources and cite sources appropriately*
    - A couple of paragraphs that document data source(s) and an explanation of how you plan on using your data
    - A link to the publically accessible datasets you plan on using, note: **using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly              encouraged**

Currently digging through several links but am running into finding proper csv files. I have found a very useful source below. 
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/big-five-personality-test/data
3. ---
I will need to parse through these csv files and determine groups and categories of personalities for both the MBTI  and Big Five personality types. It would be interesting to see similarities or differences when analyzing the two different test results. 

## Method and Medium
> *In a few sentences, document how you plan on completing your final project. Using Shorthand?*

I would like to challenge myself with Shorthand and incorporate interactive aspects from Shorthand itself and also from Canva. I envision that my final presentation format will have a simple theme with descriptive personable visualizations to describe the use and clear conflict of personality assessments.
