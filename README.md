Public Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data 2023

# About Me
Hello! My name is Ellena and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management (MAM) student at CMUâ€™s Heinz College. I studied visual arts and business administration during my undergraduate studies and during this time, the confluence of the art and corporate world sparked my interests. To materialize this interest, I decided to pursue training in Arts Management. So far in the Arts Management(MAM) program, I've had the opportunity to delve into various facets of the creative arts sector, gaining insights into its culture, ethics, policies, and analytics. Along this journey, my enthusiasm and inspiration have been ignited by the realm of museums, particularly in the domains of education, exhibitions, and development. Currently, I am working at Carnegie Museum of Art assisting the Exhibitions department with administrative project management and short-term and long-term exhibition planning!

# What I Hope to Learn
Through telling stories with data, I hope to be able to craft and design a story tailored for a specific audience regarding a subject matter that is coherent and impactful while driving engagement and well communicated. This course will allow me to continue my creative practice when crafting data visualizations and simultaneously enhance my proficiency in conducting user research and offering informed recommendations.  I would also like to further challenge myself by gaining practical and technical experience through programs and software that are introduced to us in the course.
